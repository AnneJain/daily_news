President Trump announced during a White House event that the United States had signed a trade agreement with China,

which includes provisions to expedite rare earth mineral exports that have been severely restricted since April.

川普總統在白宮活動中宣布，美國已與中國簽署一項貿易協議，並表示：「我們昨天剛和中國簽了協議。」  
不過，白宮一位官員隨後澄清，這其實是指一項旨在執行先前日內瓦協議的「共識」。  
該協議內容包含加速稀土礦物出口的條款，而這些出口自四月以來已遭嚴格限制。
